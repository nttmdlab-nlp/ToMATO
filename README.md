This is the official repository of our paper: **["ToMATO: Verbalizing the Mental States of Role-Playing LLMs for Benchmarking Theory of Mind"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08838)**

![overview](overview.png)

ToMATO is a new benchmark for evaluating Theory of Mind in LLMs.
ToMATO comprehensively evaluates Theory of Mind in a setting that better aligns with real-world scenarios compared to existing datasets.
ToMATO was generated through newly designed LLM-LLM conversations with information asymmetry, as illustrated above.
